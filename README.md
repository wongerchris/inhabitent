##Inhabitent Wordpress Website Overview
####This project is a Wordpress website built on the starter theme provided by underscores.me.  

The Inhabitent project explored a majority of the intricacies, behaviours and functionalities of the Wordpress CMS.  Wordpress powers a large percentage of websites on the web, and is therefor an important technology to know.  

For this project we were given design comps and technical requirements as goals to code and style this website as accurately as possible to the “customers” desired outcome. 

The Inhabitent project took approximately 2 weeks to complete. 

##Project Highlights

The project highlights for this project for me were learning how to add functionality to the Wordpress CMS.  This would include developing a custom functionality plugin that allowed us to add custom post types and taxonomies to our CMS.  We also built a custom widget plugin for the user to add their business hours.  

Other highlights would include adding jQuery to the navigation menu for the scroll effect which only takes place on the Front Page, About Page and Adventures Single Post Page.

I created two custom post types - Adventures and Products
####3. Plugin Development
I created a Functionality plugin and a widget plugin.
####4. The different ways to loop within Wordpress and why you would use the different loops.
I used the main Wordpress loop, customized the main Wordpress loop for the Product Archive Page so that its default number was 16, and used the foreach custom loop on the Front Page for each post type. 
####5. Wordpress REST API
We created a Ajax requests using Ajax-specific functions in WordPress and used the wp_localize_script() function to pass data from the server side to the client side by making it available in JS variables.
